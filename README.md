# Reverse_Search_Engine
 
The basic concept was referred to graph2graph search engine, which was currently banned. This search engine utilized pre-trained MobileNetV2 on animal images with NodeJS. Machine would output the class of the input image, then searching on default engine (on this one is the Google search engine). We adopted Wampserver to construct the UI interface to give public access. Primary website appearance was completed with PHP, CSS, and embedded JavaScript applications, e.g. mini games. This website was temporarily shutdown due to network unstability. 

## Content and Operation Description

### Cover Page and Home Page
Cover page was designed to welcome clients. Home page briefly described the content the server had. Client could use the buttons in home page to jump to desired functions.

### Homework Review
Since this was a course project, we put on the review of the taught codes in class. Some of them are games as well, client could enjoy playing them.

### Survivor Ball
A joyful game designed and implemented by Cheng-Chen Lin. Client is able to choose to play with keyboard or mouse. You will be assigned as the white ball in the middle. The only thing is to dodge the randomly generated balls coming from every angle. The longer you survive, the more points you earn. Come and set a record with your friends!

### Reverse Search Engine
Client should firstly upload a image. The preview will show up while the uploading is done. Then, press the "data settlement" button to set up prerequisites. After triggering the search button, the server will predict the class of the image and pop out a new tab for searching. 

**This project was in collaboration with Cheng-Chen Lin in National Chiao Tung University
